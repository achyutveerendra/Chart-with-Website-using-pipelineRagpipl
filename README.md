Web Scraping and Conversational AI with RAG Pipeline
This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered system that scrapes data from a website and interacts with users using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The system retrieves relevant information from scraped website content and answers user queries using an AI model like GPT-Neo.

Project Overview
The system consists of the following components:

Web Scraping: Scraping data from websites using Python libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup.
Data Chunking: Processing scraped content and splitting it into smaller chunks for better handling.
Embeddings Generation: Using Sentence Transformers to generate semantic embeddings for the scraped content.
Vector Store: Storing embeddings in Chroma vector database for fast similarity-based retrieval.
Text Generation: Using GPT-Neo to generate responses based on the retrieved data, powered by the RAG pipeline.
Conversational Memory: The system maintains the conversation context, allowing for a fluid interactive experience.
Interactive Chat: Users can ask questions, and the system generates responses based on the website's content.
Features
Web Scraping: Extracts headings, paragraphs, and other textual content from a provided URL.
RAG Pipeline: Combines retrieval of relevant content and generation of context-based responses.
Interactive Q&A: Allows users to ask questions, and the system responds based on scraped data.
Chroma Vector Store: Efficiently stores and retrieves embeddings for fast response times.
AI-Powered Responses: Uses GPT-Neo to generate human-like answers based on the context of the scraped content.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
2. Install Dependencies
You’ll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary environment variables for API keys and other configurations. For example:

makefile
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
4. Run the Notebook
You can open and run the provided Jupyter/Colab notebook to interact with the system:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Alternatively, if you’re using Google Colab, upload the .ipynb file and follow the instructions in the notebook.

Usage
Scrape Website: Start by scraping data from a website. Modify the scraper.py script or call the relevant function in the notebook.
Generate Embeddings: Run the embedding generation process using the embedding.py script.
Run the Conversational AI: Once the embeddings are created, interact with the system using the RAG pipeline by running the rag_pipeline.py script or through the notebook interface.
